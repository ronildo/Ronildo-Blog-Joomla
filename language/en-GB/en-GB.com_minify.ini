MINIFY_ABOUT=Combines, minifies, and caches JavaScript and CSS files on demand to speed up page loads.
MINIFY_DESCRIPTION=Minify4joomla is a PHP5 app that can combine multiple CSS or JavaScript files, compress their contents (i.e. removal of unnecessary whitespace/comments), and serve the results with HTTP encoding (gzip/deflate) and headers that allow optimal client-side caching. This helps you follow several of Yahoo!'s Rules for High Performance Web Sites.
MINIFY4JOOMLA_SETTINGS=Minify4Joomla! Settings

MIN_CACHEPATH=For best performance, specify your temp directory here. Otherwise Minify will have to load extra code to guess. Commented out below are a few possible choices.
MIN_CACHEFILELOCKING=Cache file locking. Set to false if filesystem is NFS.
MIN_ENABLEBUILDER=Allow use of the Minify URI Builder app. If you no longer need this, set to false.
MIN_ALLOWDEBUGFLAG=In 'debug' mode, Minify can combine files with no minification and add comments to indicate line #s of the original files.
MIN_ALLOWDEBUGFLAG=To allow debugging, set this option to true and add &debug=1 to a URI. E.g. /min/?f=script1.js,script2.js&debug=1
MIN_SERVEOPTIONSMAXAGE=Maximum age of browser cache in seconds. After this period, the browser will send another conditional GET. You might want to shorten this before making changes if it's crucial  those changes are seen immediately.
MIN_SERVEOPTIONSALLOWDIRS=If you'd like to restrict the 'f' option to files within/below particular directories below DOCUMENT_ROOT, set this here. You will still need to include the directory in the f or b GET parameters.
MIN_SERVEOPTIONSGROUPSONLY=Set to true to disable the 'f' GET parameter for specifying files.  Only the "g" parameter will be considered.
MIN_SERVEOPTIONSMAXFILES=Maximum # of files that can be specified in the 'f' GET parameter
MIN_UPLOADERHOURSBEHIND=If you upload files from Windows to a non-Windows server, Windows may report incorrect mtimes for the files. This may cause Minify to keep serving stale cache files when source file changes are made too frequently (e.g. more than once an hour).Immediately after modifying and uploading a file, use the touch command to update the mtime on the server. If the mtime jumps ahead by a number of hours,set this variable to that number. If the mtime moves back, this should not be needed. In the Windows SFTP client WinSCP, there's an option that may fix this issue without changing the variable below. Under login > environment, select the option "Adjust remote timestamp with DST". @link http://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_environment#daylight_saving_time
